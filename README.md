Bilingual Neural Translation (English → Hindi)
This project implements a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) system for English to Hindi translation using a Seq2Seq LSTM Encoder–Decoder architecture with Luong Attention, designed to improve contextual understanding and semantic alignment in translations.

Project Overview:
The system translates English sentences into Hindi by learning contextual relationships between source and target languages. It leverages attention mechanisms and pretrained word embeddings to significantly enhance translation quality and convergence speed.
A large-scale bilingual corpus is preprocessed and used to train the model, resulting in high translation accuracy and improved BLEU scores.
